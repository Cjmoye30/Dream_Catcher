The user story and acceptance criteria will depend on the project that you create, but your project must fulfil the following requirements:

* Include authentication (express-session and cookies).

* Protect API keys and sensitive information with environment variables.

* Be deployed using Heroku (with data).

* Have a polished UI.

* Be responsive.

* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
