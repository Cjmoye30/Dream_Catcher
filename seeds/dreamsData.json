        "description": "I had a dream I was being chased by French speaking rabid rabbits",
        "interpretation": "The fact that the rabbits are 'French-speaking' could represent a feeling of unfamiliarity or foreignness in your waking life. It could suggest that you feel like an outsider in a particular situation or environment, or that you are struggling to communicate effectively with others. Being chased in a dream often represents a feeling of being pursued or pressured in waking life. The fact that the pursuers in your dream are rabbits could suggest that you are feeling overwhelmed by small or insignificant things that are multiplying and growing out of control.",
